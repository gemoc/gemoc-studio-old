If the trace model supports a notion of date associated to an occurrence, the trace editor should also allow searching for sequences in a trace that have timing properties (for instance, two consecutive occurrences of A with dates separated by more than some duration).

\subsection{ModhelX}
%Start of user code ModhelX
ModHel'X is both a meta model and an execution engine for heterogeneous models which is developed at the Computer Science Department of Supélec.
%End of user code

\subsubsection{Purpose}
%Start of user code ModhelXDescription
The purpose of ModHel'X is the modeling of hierarchical heterogeneous models. In order to handle heterogeneous components in a model, ModHel'X relies on a generic meta-model based on black boxes (called blocks) with observable ports (called pins). A ModHel'X model is composed of a structure (blocks with relations between their pins) and a model of computation which implements the rules for combining the behavior of the blocks as observed at their pins.

ModHel'X supports only hierarchical heterogeneity through the use of interface blocks. An interface block is a block used according to an external model of computation, and the behavior of this block is defined by a model which uses an internal model of computation. The interface block, is responsible for adapting the execution semantics between the external and the internal models of computation. This adaptation is decomposed along three axis: transforming input and output data, synchronizing the control (occurrence of events) in both models of computation, and maintaining relations between the time scales inside and outside the interface block.

For modeling the relations between the occurrence of events and the time scales in different models of computation, ModHel'X relies on a time model and a solver for these relations. This time model is called TESL (Tagged Event Specification Language) and is inspired by the Tagged Signal Model by Lee and Sangiovanni, and the CCSL language developed by the AOSTE INRIA team. Contrary to CCSL, TESL and its solver can only construct one execution trace by applying causality relations and constraints on the tags (dates) of events. It has been designed for specifying how to execute an heterogeneous model, while CCSL is more suitable to specify constraints on all possible executions of an heterogeneous model. Thanks to its reduced expressive power with regard to the ordering of events, and to its reduced analysis possibilities, TESL is able to handle constraints on the tags which are associated to event occurrences, which makes it handy and efficient for executing heterogeneous models. It would theoretically be possible to model such relations in CCSL using infinitely fast clocks. There are currently discussions about the possibility to determine if a TESL model is a correct implementation of a CCSL specification. With such a possibility, we could use CCSL for specifying a model of computation and then use TESL to write an implementation of this model of computation. The specification would allow static verification of properties, while the implementation would allow efficient simulations.

The current architecture of ModHel'X is not aligned on the Gemoc framework, and part of the contribution of Supélec is to modify its structure to make it usable as an execution engine and a solver in the Gemoc framework.

\subsection{Trace Model}
%Start of user code Trace Model_interface
The Trace Model is used to represent execution traces as sequences of domain specific event occurrences, eventually annotated with values when the behavior of the model produces data.

\subsection{Kermeta Model}
%Start of user code Kermeta Model_interface

%End of user code

\subsection{Scenario Model}
%Start of user code Scenario Model_interface
The Scenario Model is used to represent input scenarios for the Scenario Policy. An input scenario contains the information needed to choose a DSE among the DSE occurrences that can occur according to the model of computation. A scenario is more abstract than a trace (which makes a difference between the Scenario Policy and the Replay Policy) and may consist in tactics like ``alternate between two choices''.

\subsection{Execution Model}
%Start of user code Execution Model_interface
The Execution Model is used to describe the state of a model during its execution. This includes attributes that are used and modified by the DSA, as well as execution state attributes used by the model of computation.
